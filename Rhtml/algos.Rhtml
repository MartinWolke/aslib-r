<h2> Overview of performance values </h2>

The following measures were taken from the performance values of each algorithm:
<ul>

  <li> <a>Min: Minimum</a>
  <li> <a>1st Qu.: 1st Quartile = lower Quartile = 25%-Quantile</a>
  <li> <a>Median: Median = 50%-Quantile</a>
  <li> <a>Mean: Arithmetic Mean</a>
  <li> <a>3rd Qu.: 3rd Quartile = upper Quartile = 75%-Quantile</a>
  <li> <a>Max.: Maximum</a>
  <li> <a>Std. Dev.: Standard Deviation</a>
  <li> <a>CoV.: Coefficient of Variation = Standard Deviation / Arithmetic Mean</a>
  <li> <a>NA's: Number of NAs (missing values) within the feature set.</a>
  <li> <a>Obs.: Number of Observations within the feature set.</a>
  <li> <a>Run OK (%): Percentage of feature computations without a crash.</a>

</ul>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = summarizeAlgoRuns(astask)
  print(xtable(res, digits = c(0, rep(3, 8), 0, 0, 3)), "html")
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Summary of the runstatus per algorithm </h2>

The following table summarizes the runstatus of each algorithm over all instances (in %).<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = summarizeAlgoRunstatus(astask)
  print(xtable(res, digits = 3), "html")
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Dominated Algorithms </h2>

Here, you'll find an overview of dominating/dominated algorithms: <br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = findDominatedAlgos(astask)
  if (!is.null(res)) {
    print(xtable(res), include.rownames = TRUE, "html")
  } else {
    cat("None of the algorithms was superior to any of the other.")
  }  
end.rcode-->

<br>
<br>
<h2> Useless Algorithms </h2>

Here, you'll find all the algorithms that always resulted in the same performance (and eventually NA's):<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = findUselessInstances(astask)$algo.runs
  if(nrow(res) >= 1) {
    print(xtable(res), "html")
  } else {
    cat("There were no entirely useless algorithms.")
  }
end.rcode-->

<br>
<br>
<h2> Boxplots of performance values </h2>

Any observations with missing values in their algorithms' performance were removed prior to the creation of the boxplots.<br>
Additionally, if the performance is represented on a log-scale, all non-positive performance values were removed as well.<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode
  plotAlgoPerfBoxplots(astask, log = config$algo.perf.boxplots.log)
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Estimated densitities of performance values </h2>

Any observations with missing values in their algorithms' performance were removed prior to the creation of the density plot.<br>
Additionally, if the performance is represented on a log-scale, all non-positive performance values were removed as well.<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode
  plotAlgoPerfDensities(astask, log = config$algo.perf.densities.log) 
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Estimated cumulative distribution functions of performance values </h2>

Any observations with missing values in their algorithms' performance were removed prior to the creation of the cumulative distribution plot.<br>
Additionally, if the performance is represented on a log-scale, all non-positive performance values were removed as well.<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode
  plotAlgoPerfProbability(astask, log = config$algo.perf.probabilities.log) 
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Scatterplot matrix of the performance values </h2>

The following figure creates pairwise scatterplots of the performance values, 
including a regression line (cf. upper panel), a histogram of each performance
value (cf. diagonal), as well as the pairwise (pearson) correlation (cf. lower
panel).<br>
In order to facilitate the lucidity of the correlations, they are colored
depending on their value. Thus, a high positive correlation (&ge; 0.8) is
colored green, light correlations (between 0.3 and 0.8, or -0.8 and -0.3)
are orange, little to no correlations (&ge; -0.3 and &le; 0.3) are written
in black and high negative correlations (&le; -0.8) are shown red.

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  plotAlgoScattermatrix(astask, log = config$algo.perf.scatter.log)
end.rcode-->


<br>
<h2> Clustering algorithms based on their correlations </h2>
The following figure shows the correlations of the performance values. Per
default it will show the correlation coefficient of pearson. If NA's exist,
they were removed pairwise. <br>
In addition, the algorithms are ordered in a way that similar (highly
correlated) algorithms are close to each other. Per default the clustering
is based on hierarchical clustering, using Ward's method. <br>
<br>

ATTENTION: <br>
As the correlations from this figure always depend on the original performance
values, they might be different to the values shown in the scatterplot matrix,
which could be log-scaled (depending on the setting). <br>

<!--begin.rcode
  plotAlgoCorMatrix(astask) 
end.rcode-->
