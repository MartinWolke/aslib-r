<h2> Overview of performance values </h2>

The following measures were taken from the performance values of each algorithm:
<ul>

  <li> <a>Min: Minimum</a>
  <li> <a>1st Qu.: 1st Quartile = lower Quartile = 25%-Quantile</a>
  <li> <a>Median: Median = 50%-Quantile</a>
  <li> <a>Mean: Arithmetic Mean</a>
  <li> <a>3rd Qu.: 3rd Quartile = upper Quartile = 75%-Quantile</a>
  <li> <a>Max.: Maximum</a>
  <li> <a>Std. Dev.: Standard Deviation</a>
  <li> <a>CoV.: Coefficient of Variation = Standard Deviation / Arithmetic Mean</a>
  <li> <a>NA's: Number of NAs (missing values) within the feature set.</a>
  <li> <a>Obs.: Number of Observations within the feature set.</a>
  <li> <a>Run OK (%): Percentage of feature computations without a crash.</a>

</ul>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = summarizeAlgoRuns(astask)
  print(xtable(res, digits = c(0, rep(3, 8), 0, 0, 3)), "html")
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Summary of the runstatus per algorithm </h2>

The following table summarizes the runstatus of each algorithm over all instances (in %).<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = summarizeAlgoRunstatus(astask)
  print(xtable(res, digits = 3), "html")
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Dominated Algorithms </h2>

Here, you'll find an overview of dominating/dominated algorithms: <br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = findDominatedAlgos(astask)
  if (!is.null(res)) {
    print(xtable(res), include.rownames = TRUE, "html")
  } else {
    cat("None of the algorithms was superior to any of the other.")
  }  
end.rcode-->

<br>
<br>
<h2> Useless Algorithms </h2>

Here, you'll find all the algorithms that always resulted in the same performance (and eventually NA's):<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  res = findUselessInstances(astask)$algo.runs
  if(nrow(res) >= 1) {
    print(xtable(res), "html")
  } else {
    cat("There were no entirely useless algorithms.")
  }
end.rcode-->

<br>
<br>
<b><FONT COLOR = "#FF0000"> Important Note:</b><br>
Depending on the configuration, missing values among the algorithms' performance values
were imputed prior to the creation of the following plots (except for the correlation 
matrix, cf. bottom of this page).<br>
Missing values were imputed to max + 0.3 * (max - min), in case of minimization problems, 
or min - 0.3 * (max - min), in case of maximization problems.<br>
In addition, a small noise is added to the imputed values. </FONT>
<br>
<br>

<h2> Boxplots of performance values </h2>

If the performance is represented on a log-scale, all non-positive performance values were removed.<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode
  plotAlgoPerfBoxplots(astask, log = config$algo.perf.boxplots.log, na.impute = config$algo.perf.impute.nas)
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Estimated densitities of performance values </h2>

If the performance is represented on a log-scale, all non-positive performance values were removed as well.<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode
  plotAlgoPerfDensities(astask, log = config$algo.perf.densities.log, na.impute = config$algo.perf.impute.nas) 
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Estimated cumulative distribution functions of performance values </h2>

If the performance is represented on a log-scale, all non-positive performance values were removed as well.<br>
<br>

<!--begin.rcode
  plotAlgoPerfProbability(astask, log = config$algo.perf.probabilities.log, na.impute = config$algo.perf.impute.nas) 
end.rcode-->

<br>
<h2> Scatterplot matrix of the performance values </h2>

The following figure creates pairwise scatterplots of the (possibly transformed) 
performance values, including a regression line (cf. upper panel), a histogram 
of each performance value (cf. diagonal), as well as the pairwise (pearson) 
correlation (cf. lower panel).<br>
In order to facilitate the lucidity of the correlations, they are colored
depending on their value. Thus, a high positive correlation (&ge; 0.8) is
colored green, light correlations (between 0.3 and 0.8, or -0.8 and -0.3)
are orange, little to no correlations (&ge; -0.3 and &le; 0.3) are written
in black and high negative correlations (&le; -0.8) are shown red.<br>
Eventually, the performance values are transformed, based on the settings
within its config-file. However, the corresponding transformation is mentioned
within the subtitle underneath the figure.

<!--begin.rcode, results = "asis"
  plotAlgoScattermatrix(astask, trafo = config$algo.perf.scatter.trafo, na.impute = config$algo.perf.impute.nas)
end.rcode-->


<br>
<h2> Clustering algorithms based on their correlations </h2>
The following figure shows the correlations of the <b>ranks</b> of the performance 
values. Per default it will show the correlation coefficient of pearson. If NA's 
exist, they were removed pairwise. <br>
In addition, the algorithms are ordered in a way that similar (highly
correlated) algorithms are close to each other. Per default the clustering
is based on hierarchical clustering, using Ward's method. <br>

  plotAlgoCorMatrix(astask)
