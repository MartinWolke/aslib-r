#' Creates a table that shows the dominance of one algorithm over another one.
#'
#' Stochastic replications are currently aggregated by the mean value.
#' If NAs occur, they are imputed before aggregation either by 10 * cutoff
#' (for runtimes tasks with cutoff) or 10 * <worst performance> for all others.
#'
#' @param astask [\code{\link{ASTask}}]\cr
#'   Algorithm selection task.
#' @param measure [\code{character(1)}]\cr
#'   Measure for algorithm performance.
#'   Default is first measure in task.
#' @param reduce [\code{logical(1)}]\cr
#'   Should the resulting matrix be reduced to algorithms that a are either dominated by or dominate
#'   another algorithm?
#'   Default is \code{FALSE}.
#' @param type [\code{character(1)}]\cr
#'   Data type of the result object.\cr
#'   \dQuote{logical}: Logical matrix, TRUE means row algorithm dominates column algorithm.\cr
#'   \dQuote{character}: Same information but more human-readable. States how the row relates to the column.
#' @return [\code{matrix}]. See above.
