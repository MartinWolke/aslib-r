\title{Create cross-validation splits for a task.}
\usage{
createCVSplits(astask, reps = 1L, folds = 10L, file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{astask}{[\code{\link{ASTask}}]\cr Algorithm
  selection task.}

  \item{reps}{[\code{integer}]\cr CV repetitions.  Default
  is 1.}

  \item{folds}{[\code{integer}]\cr CV folds.  Default is
  10.}

  \item{file}{[\code{character}]\cr If not missing, where
  to save the returned splits as an ARFF file via
  \code{\link{write.arff}}.  Default is no saving.}
}
\value{
[\code{data.frame}]. Splits as defined in the algorithm
benchmark repository specification text.  Has columns:
\dQuote{instance_id}, \dQuote{fold}, \dQuote{rep}.  Defines
which instances go into the test set for each replication /
fold during CV.  The training set are the remaining
instances, in exactly the order as given by the data.frame
for the current repetition.
