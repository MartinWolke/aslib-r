\title{Creates a registry which can be used for running several Llama models on a cluster.}
\usage{
runLlamaModels(asscenarios, feature.steps.list = NULL, baselines = NULL,
  learners = list(), par.sets = list(), rs.iters = 100L,
  n.inner.folds = 2L, pre)
}
\arguments{
\item{asscenarios}{[(list of) \code{\link{ASScenario}}]\cr
Algorithm selection scenarios.}

\item{feature.steps.list}{[\code{list} of \code{character}]\cr
Named list of feature steps we want to use.
Must be named with scenario ids.
Default is to take the default feature steps from the scenario.}

\item{baselines}{[\code{character}]\cr
Vector of characters, defining the baseline models.
Default is c("vbs", "singleBest", "singleBestByPar", "singleBestBySuccesses").}

\item{learners}{[list of \code{\link[mlr]{Learner}}]\cr
mlr learners to use for modeling.
Default is none.}

\item{par.sets}{[list of \code{\link[ParamHelpers]{ParamSet}}]\cr
Param sets for learners to tune via random search.
Pass an empty param set, if you want no tuning.
Must be in of same length as \code{learners} and in the same order.
Default is none.}

\item{rs.iters}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Number of iterations for random search hyperparameter tuning.
Default is 100.}

\item{n.inner.folds}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Number of cross-validation folds for inner CV in hyperparameter tuning.
Default is 2L.}

\item{pre}{[\code{function}]\cr
A function (e.g. normalize) to preprocess the feature data.
By default no preprocessing is done.}
}
\value{
BatchExperiments registry.

\description{
It is likely that you need to install some additional R packages for this from CRAN or extra
Weka learner. The latter can be one via e.g. \code{WPM("install-package", "XMeans")}.

Feature costs are added for real prognostic models but not for baseline models.

Machine learning models are run with their default settings.
For the clusterers we set the number of clusters (N) to the number of algorithms in the scenario.
Except for XMeans where we set the maximum number of clusters (H) in the same way, as
a parameter for the number of clusters does not exist.
